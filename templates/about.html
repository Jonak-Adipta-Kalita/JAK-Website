            My name is JONAK ADIPTA KALITA. I am a student in Kendriya Vidyalaya Mangaldoi, 
			I am currently studying in standard '8th'. I am a Coder and also a 'Home Game 
			Developer'. I code for fun but sometimes I also teach some of my colleagues some 
			'Python'. I love Python and JavaScript the most. I am a Youtuber too. I love to 
			play Games such as NFS, COD, AC, Among Us, GTA, etc. I am a huge fan of Anime and 
			watched 'Pokemon', 'One_Piece', 'Beyblade', 'DBG'. If you want to get to my 
			Instagram or Github you have to find it by yourself. Actually you'll find my Social 
			Medias in the Social Media Page.
